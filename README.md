# Call of Duty League Data Visualizations

## Overview of Analysis

### Background

Founded by the game developer, Activision, in 2018, the Call of Duty League (CDL) is the premier professional esports league for the video game series, Call of Duty. Similar to other professional sports leagues, countless player, team, and match datapoints are produced through CDL competition. Through analysis, these datapoints allow us to gain insight into different aspects of CDL competition, such as which teams are performing at their best or which players seem to be lacking. Focusing on the 2023-2024 CDL season, I seek to uncover these trends by using the dataset that I built from my [breakingpoint.gg web scraping project](https://github.com/dharlerjr/bp_web_scraping) and examining what I consider to be six major aspects of CDL competition. Along the way, I will create over one-hundred data visalizations to support my conclusions. This project is coded entirely in RStudio, and the following CRAN packages were essential to my analysis:

- tidyverse: for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization
- RPostgres: for loading my CDL dataset from my PostgreSQL database into RStudio
- gt & gtExtras: for constructing tables to visualization data
- RColorBrewer & Viridis: for coloring my visualizations
- scales: for scaling my data-colors in my gt tables
